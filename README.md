# cs-4501-pedometer-project

Pedometer project for CS 4501, Engineering Interactive Technologies

In this project, we developed a step-counting algorithm to count steps off-line. This program is tested in real-world datasets with a 90% accuracy.

## Set up

- To set up the project, simply install the dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Alternatively, install the two dependencies manually: `pip install pandas matplotlib`.
